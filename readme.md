# Marvel
This is a mini-project that I made using Swift. It's a command line program that takes a user input to create a character and play a game against an opponent. This mini-project is created with design pattern in mind. I built this program using Factory Pattern, Builder Pattern, and Strategy Pattern. I also utilized Protocol-Oriented programming that's exclusive only to Swift.

## Instructions
I haven't created a script for this program, so you need to open it in Xcode and run it manually from there.<br>
Follow the in-game prompts to play the game.<br>
